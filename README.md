# Low-Power-Memory-Design
This repository contains all the peripheral circuits along with the standard 6T SRAM cell, which are needed for the 4x4 Memory Architecture.
I have also made a 1-Kb Memory Design whose files will not be uploaded here, although I may upload the full documentation.
Some circuits are modified or redesigned, like the sense amplifier, for low-power applications.
To access these files, one needs to have the license for Cadence Viruoso.
