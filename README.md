# Low-Power-Memory-Design
This repository contains all the peripheral circuits along-with the standard 6T SRAM cell which are needed for 4x4 Memory Architecture.
I am currently working on the 1-Kb Memory Design whose files will be uploaded soon.
Some circuits are modified or redesigned like the sense amplifier for low power applications.
To access these files, one need to have the license of Cadence Viruoso.
